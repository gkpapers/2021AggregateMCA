  abstract = "Diffusion Imaging in Python (Dipy) is a free and open source
              software project for the analysis of data from diffusion magnetic
              resonance imaging (dMRI) experiments. dMRI is an application of
              MRI that can be used to measure structural features of brain
              white matter. Many methods have been developed to use dMRI data
              to model the local configuration of white matter nerve fiber
              bundles and infer the trajectory of bundles connecting different
              parts of the brain. Dipy gathers implementations of many
              different methods in dMRI, including: diffusion signal
              pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion distributions in
              individual voxels; fiber tractography and fiber track
              post-processing, analysis and visualization. Dipy aims to provide
              transparent implementations for all the different steps of dMRI
              analysis with a uniform programming interface. We have
              implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as
              the diffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography.
              In addition, cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are
              implemented, such as constrained spherical deconvolution and
              diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) with deconvolution, as well as
              methods for probabilistic tracking and original methods for
              tractography clustering. Many additional utility functions are
              provided to calculate various statistics, informative
              visualizations, as well as file-handling routines to assist in
              the development and use of novel techniques. In contrast to many
              other scientific software projects, Dipy is not being developed
              by a single research group. Rather, it is an open project that
              encourages contributions from any scientist/developer through
              GitHub and open discussions on the project mailing list.
              Consequently, Dipy today has an international team of
              contributors, spanning seven different academic institutions in
              five countries and three continents, which is still growing.",

              proposes to model brain development with a novel non-negative
              projective dictionary learning (NPDL) approach, which learns a
              discriminative representation of multi-modal neuroimaging data
              for predicting brain age. Our approach encodes the variability of
              subjects in different age groups using separate dictionaries,
              projecting features into a low-dimensional manifold such that
              information is preserved only for the corresponding age group.
              The proposed framework improves upon previous discriminative
              dictionary learning methods by incorporating orthogonality and
              non-negativity constraints, which remove representation
              redundancy and perform implicit feature selection. We study brain
              development on multi-modal brain imaging data from the PING
              dataset (N = 841, age = 3-21 years). The proposed analysis uses
              our NDPL framework to predict the age of subjects based on
              cortical measures from T1-weighted MRI and connectome from
              diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). We also investigate the

              recruiting 1200 + healthy adults aged 36 to 100+, with a subset
              of 600 + participants returning for longitudinal assessment. Four
              acquisition sites using matched Siemens Prisma 3T MRI scanners
              with centralized quality control and data analysis are enrolling
              participants. Data are acquired across multimodal imaging and
              behavioral domains with a focus on factors known to be altered in
              advanced aging. MRI acquisitions include structural (whole brain
              and high resolution hippocampal) plus multiband resting state
              functional (rfMRI), task fMRI (tfMRI), diffusion MRI (dMRI), and
              arterial spin labeling (ASL). Behavioral characterization
              includes cognitive (such as processing speed and episodic
              memory), psychiatric, metabolic, and socioeconomic measures as
              well as assessment of systemic health (with a focus on menopause
              via hormonal assays). This dataset will provide a unique resource
              for examining how brain organization and connectivity changes
              across typical aging, and how these differences relate to key
              characteristics of aging including alterations in hormonal status
              and declining memory and general cognition. A primary goal of the
              HCP-A is to make these data freely available to the scientific
              community, supported by the Connectome Coordination Facility
              (CCF) platform for data quality assurance, preprocessing and
              basic analysis, and shared via the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). Here

  abstract = "Structural brain networks constructed from diffusion MRI (dMRI)
              and tractography have been demonstrated in healthy volunteers and
              more recently in various disorders affecting brain connectivity.
              However, few studies have addressed the reproducibility of the
              resulting networks. We measured the test--retest properties of
              such networks by varying several factors affecting network
              construction using ten healthy volunteers who underwent a dMRI
              protocol at 1.5T on two separate occasions. Each T1-weighted
              brain was parcellated into 84 regions-of-interest and network
              connections were identified using dMRI and two alternative
              tractography algorithms, two alternative seeding strategies, a
              white matter waypoint constraint and three alternative network
              weightings. In each case, four common graph-theoretic measures
              were obtained. Network properties were assessed both node-wise
              and per network in terms of the intraclass correlation
              coefficient (ICC) and by comparing within- and between-subject
              differences. Our findings suggest that test--retest performance
              was improved when: 1) seeding from white matter, rather than
              grey; and 2) using probabilistic tractography with a two-fibre
              model and sufficient streamlines, rather than deterministic
              tensor tractography. In terms of network weighting, a measure of
              streamline density produced better test--retest performance than
              tract-averaged diffusion anisotropy, although it remains unclear
              which is a more accurate representation of the underlying
              connectivity. For the best performing configuration, the global
              within-subject differences were between 3.2\% and 11.9\% with
              ICCs between 0.62 and 0.76. The mean nodal within-subject
              differences were between 5.2\% and 24.2\% with mean ICCs between
              0.46 and 0.62. For 83.3\% (70/84) of nodes, the within-subject
              differences were smaller than between-subject differences.
              Overall, these findings suggest that whilst current techniques
              produce networks capable of characterising the genuine
              between-subject differences in connectivity, future work must be
              undertaken to improve network reliability.",

  abstract = "In the first part of the paper we consider the problem of
              dynamically apportioning resources among a set of options in a
              worst-case on-line framework. The model we study can be
              interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied
              on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting.
              We show that the multiplicative weight-update
              Littlestone--Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding
              bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to
              a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show
              how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety
              of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction,
              repeated games, and prediction of points in Rn. In the second

              technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting
              algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the
              performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study
              generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Given percentages of VO(2max) are widely used for
              training and study purposes although they might not result in
              homogeneous metabolic strain. Therefore, the homogeneity of
              metabolic responses to prolonged exercise at fixed percentages of
              VO(2max) should be investigated. PROCEDURES: Twenty-one healthy
              male subjects (29+/-5 years, 77+/-8 kg, VO(2max): 59.9+/-11.8 ml
              min(-1)kg(-1)) performed two incremental tests to exhaustion on a
              cycle ergometer to determine VO(2max). Subsequently, two 60 min
              tests at 60 and 75\% VO(2max) were conducted in randomised order.
              VO(2) was kept constant by adjusting the work rate. Blood lactate
              (La) responses as primary outcome variable to quantify metabolic
              strain were assessed. FINDINGS: Mean La was 2.1+/-1.1 mmol l(-1)
              (min-max: 0.7-5.6 mmol l(-1)) during the 60\% VO(2max) test and
              4.6+/-1.9 mmol l(-1) (min-max: 2.2-8.0 mmol l(-1)) during the
              75\% VO(2max) test. The coefficients of variation of La amounted
              for 52.4 and 41.3\% during the 60 and 75\% VO(2max) test,
              respectively. La responses did not differ significantly between
              three subgroups of the subjects (N=7 with VO(2max)65 ml
              min(-1)kg(-1); P>or=0.08). CONCLUSION: Altogether, prolonged
              exercise at given percentages of VO(2max) leads to inhomogeneous
              metabolic strain as indicated by the large variability of La
              responses. This holds true even in subgroups of similar aerobic
              capacity. Thus, intensity prescription for endurance training and
              study purposes should not be solely based upon percentages of
              VO(2max) when a comparable metabolic strain is intended.",

  abstract = "A healthy lifestyle is an important focus in today's society. The
              physical benefits of regular exercise are abundantly clear, but
              physical fitness is also associated with better cognitive
              performance. How these two factors together relate to
              characteristics of the brain is still incompletely understood. By
              applying mathematical concepts from 'network theory', insights in
              the organization and dynamics of brain functioning can be
              obtained. We test the hypothesis that neural network organization
              mediates the association between cardio respiratory fitness (i.e.
              VO₂ max) and cognitive functioning. A healthy cohort was studied
              (n = 219, 113 women, age range 41-44 years). Subjects underwent
              resting-state eyes-closed magneto-encephalography (MEG). Five
              artifact-free epochs were analyzed and averaged in six frequency
              bands (delta-gamma). The phase lag index (PLI) was used as a
              measure of functional connectivity between all sensors.
              Modularity analysis was performed, and both within and
              between-module connectivity of each sensor was calculated.
              Subjects underwent a maximum oxygen uptake (VO₂ max) measurement
              as an indicator of cardio respiratory fitness. All subjects were
              tested with a commonly used Dutch intelligence test. Intelligence
              quotient (IQ) was related to VO₂ max. In addition, VO₂ max was
              negatively associated with upper alpha and beta band modularity.
              Particularly increased intermodular connectivity in the beta band
              was associated with higher VO₂ max and IQ, further indicating a
              benefit of more global network integration as opposed to local
              connections. Within-module connectivity showed a spatially varied
              pattern of correlation, while average connectivity did not show
              significant results. Mediation analysis was not significant. The
              occurrence of less modularity in the resting-state is associated
              with better cardio respiratory fitness, while having increased
              intermodular connectivity, as opposed to within-module
              connections, is related to better physical and mental fitness.",

              brain networks that accompanies normal aging is based on
              neuroimaging studies in which participants perform specific
              tasks. In these studies, reorganization is defined by the
              differences in task activation between young and old adults.
              However, task activation differences could be the result of
              differences in task performance, strategy, or motivation, and not
              necessarily reflect reorganization. Resting-state fMRI provides a
              method of investigating functional brain networks without such
              confounds. Here, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was
              used in an attempt to differentiate older adults from younger
              adults based on their resting-state functional connectivity. In
              addition, the information used by the SVM was investigated to see
              what functional connections best differentiated younger adult
              brains from older adult brains. Three separate resting-state
              scans from 26 younger adults (18-35 yrs) and 26 older adults
              (55-85) were obtained from the International Consortium for Brain
              Mapping (ICBM) dataset made publically available in the 1000
              Functional Connectomes project www.nitrc.org/projects/fcon\_1000.
              100 seed-regions from four functional networks with 5mm(3) radius
              were defined based on a recent study using machine learning
              classifiers on adolescent brains. Time-series for every
              seed-region were averaged and three matrices of z-transformed
              correlation coefficients were created for each subject
              corresponding to each individual's three resting-state scans. SVM
              was then applied using leave-one-out cross-validation. The SVM
              classifier was 84\% accurate in classifying older and younger
              adult brains. The majority of the connections used by the
              classifier to distinguish subjects by age came from seed-regions
              belonging to the sensorimotor and cingulo-opercular networks.
              These results suggest that age-related decreases in positive
              correlations within the cingulo-opercular and default networks,
              and decreases in negative correlations between the default and

  abstract = "Currently, classification of alcohol use disorder (AUD) is made
              on clinical grounds; however, robust evidence shows that chronic
              alcohol use leads to neurochemical and neurocircuitry
              adaptations. Identifications of the neuronal networks that are
              affected by alcohol would provide a more systematic way of
              diagnosis and provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of
              AUD. In this study, we identified network-level brain features of
              AUD, and further quantified resting-state within-network, and
              between-network connectivity features in a multivariate fashion
              that are classifying AUD, thus providing additional information
              about how each network contributes to alcoholism. Resting-state
              fMRI were collected from 92 individuals (46 controls and 46
              AUDs). Probabilistic Independent Component Analysis (PICA) was
              used to extract brain functional networks and their corresponding
              time-course for AUD and controls. Both within-network
              connectivity for each network and between-network connectivity
              for each pair of networks were used as features. Random forest
              was applied for pattern classification. The results showed that
              within-networks features were able to identify AUD and control
              with 87.0\% accuracy and 90.5\% precision, respectively. Networks
              that were most informative included Executive Control Networks
              (ECN), and Reward Network (RN). The between-network features
              achieved 67.4\% accuracy and 70.0\% precision. The
              between-network connectivity between RN-Default Mode Network
              (DMN) and RN-ECN contribute the most to the prediction. In
              conclusion, within-network functional connectivity offered
              maximal information for AUD classification, when compared with
              between-network connectivity. Further, our results suggest that
              connectivity within the ECN and RN are informative in classifying
              AUD. Our findings suggest that machine-learning algorithms

              probabilistic streamline tractography applied to high angular
              resolution diffusion imaging. Tract-based spatial statistics was

              Results also demonstrated that structural brain networks

               brain imaging techniques such as Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI),

               by using image processing and statistical methods, these
               networks explain how brain regions interact with each other.
               Brain networks can be used to train machine learning models that
               can help the diagnosis of neurological disorders. In this study,
               two types (DTI, fMRI) of brain connectivity networks are
               examined to retrieve graph theory based knowledge and feature
               vectors of samples. The classification model is developed by
               integrating three machine learning algorithms with a na{\"\i}ve
               voting scheme. The evaluation of the proposed model is performed
               on the brain connectivity samples of patients with Autism
               Spectrum Disorder. When the classification model is compared
               with another state-of-the-art study, it is seen that the
               proposed method outperforms the other one. Thus, graph-based
               measures computed on brain connectivity networks might help to
               improve diagnostic capability of in-silico methods. This study
               introduces a graph theory based classification model for
               diagnostic purposes that can be easily adapted for different

              Bullmore, Edward T",
  abstract = "Brain networks or 'connectomes' include a minority of highly
              connected hub nodes that are functionally valuable, because their
              topological centrality supports integrative processing and
              adaptive behaviours. Recent studies also suggest that hubs have
              higher metabolic demands and longer-distance connections than
              other brain regions, and therefore could be considered
              biologically costly. Assuming that hubs thus normally combine
              both high topological value and high biological cost, we
              predicted that pathological brain lesions would be concentrated
              in hub regions. To test this general hypothesis, we first
              identified the hubs of brain anatomical networks estimated from
              diffusion tensor imaging data on healthy volunteers (n = 56), and
              showed that computational attacks targeted on hubs
              disproportionally degraded the efficiency of brain networks
              compared to random attacks. We then prepared grey matter lesion
              maps, based on meta-analyses of published magnetic resonance
              imaging data on more than 20 000 subjects and 26 different brain
              disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging lesions that were common
              across all brain disorders were more likely to be located in hubs
              of the normal brain connectome (P < 10(-4), permutation test).
              Specifically, nine brain disorders had lesions that were
              significantly more likely to be located in hubs (P < 0.05,
              permutation test), including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's
              disease. Both these disorders had significantly hub-concentrated
              lesion distributions, although (almost completely) distinct
              subsets of cortical hubs were lesioned in each disorder: temporal
              lobe hubs specifically were associated with higher lesion
              probability in Alzheimer's disease, whereas in schizophrenia
              lesions were concentrated in both frontal and temporal cortical
              hubs. These results linking pathological lesions to the
              topological centrality of nodes in the normal diffusion tensor
              imaging connectome were generally replicated when hubs were
              defined instead by the meta-analysis of more than 1500
              task-related functional neuroimaging studies of healthy
              volunteers to create a normative functional co-activation
              network. We conclude that the high cost/high value hubs of human
              brain networks are more likely to be anatomically abnormal than
              non-hubs in many (if not all) brain disorders.",
